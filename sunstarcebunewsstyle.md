2) Possessives

a) Use 's to form the plural of nouns not ending in s. Examples: Miss David's, children's

b) use 's to form the plural of proper nouns or names ending in a sounded s, such as Marites's, the chorus's, Mars's

Examples: John and Mary's car, but John's and Mary's rooms.

Wait requires a preposition such as for. However, the idiom is: *wait one's turn*.

While is a noun. Awhile is an adverb for a short time. It is redundant to write for awhile.

**commas**

1) Use a comma to separate words and simple phrases in a series, but not before the conjunction.

red, white, green and blue

she danced, sang and talked the night away.

2) You need a comma to set off words in apposition u the words that are identifiers. If an apposition is eliminated, the sentence will still be grammatically correct.

3) use a comma to introduce a one-sentence direct quote, but not before indirect quotes.

She said, "I hope you'll enjoy your meal."

She said she was sorry to be late.

10) use a comma before designations of academic or professional degrees and religious orders, but not before Jr., Sr., Ltd., Inc. and Roman numerals after names.

11) You generally won't need a comma before or after too.

12) Commas should not be used around restrictive clauses and phrases. A clause is restrictive if its omission would alter the meaning of the sentence.

**Compliment**, **complement**

Examples: a first-rate play, large-scale project, far-reaching legislation, record-breaking feat

2) If a modifier preceding a noun contains several words, all must be hyphenated except when the noun phrase is capitalized.

too-good-to-be-true bonus

large-than-life cartoon character

You will notice, however, that these modifiers are awkward and can thus be rephrased.

Better - She thought the bonus was too good to be true.

3) Do not hyphenate a compound in which the first element is an adverb ending in ly: a completely inept performance, her eagerly awaited visit.

**comprise**

Means contain or consist of. The whole comprises the parts, so write: The alphabet comprises 26 letters. Don't write: The alphabet is comprised of 26 letters.

This refers to a form of property ownership, not a type of structure. An apartment or townhouse may or may not be a condominium.

Make sure each modifier refers clearly to a word in the sentence.

Dangling: Worn on a chain, I showed the pendant off to my friends. Better: Worn on a chain, the pendant drew many admiring looks.
