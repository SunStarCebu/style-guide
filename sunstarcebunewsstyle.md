2) Possessives

a) Use 's to form the plural of nouns not ending in s. Examples: Miss David's, children's

b) use 's to form the plural of proper nouns or names ending in a sounded s, such as Marites's, the chorus's, Mars's

Examples: John and Mary's car, but John's and Mary's rooms.

While is a noun. Awhile is an adverb for a short time. It is redundant to write for awhile.

red, white, green and blue

10) use a comma before designations of academic or professional degrees and religious orders, but not before Jr., Sr., Ltd., Inc. and Roman numerals after names.

11) You generally won't need a comma before or after too.

12) Commas should not be used around restrictive clauses and phrases. A clause is restrictive if its omission would alter the meaning of the sentence.

2) If a modifier preceding a noun contains several words, all must be hyphenated except when the noun phrase is capitalized.

You will notice, however, that these modifiers are awkward and can thus be rephrased.
